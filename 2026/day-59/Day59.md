### Task 1: Install Helm
1. Install Helm (brew, curl script, or chocolatey depending on your OS)
2. Verify with `helm version` and `helm env`
choco -v
choco install kubernetes-helm -y
Three core concepts:
- **Chart** — a package of Kubernetes manifest templates
- **Release** — a specific installation of a chart in your cluster
- **Repository** — a collection of charts (like a package repo)

**Verify:** What version of Helm is installed?
 helm version
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v4.1.4", GitCommit:"05fa37973dc9e42b76e1d2883494c87174b6074f", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.25.9", KubeClientVersion:"v1.35"}


1. Add the Bitnami repository: `helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami`
2. Update: `helm repo update`
3. Search: `helm search repo nginx` and `helm search repo bitnami`

**Verify:** How many charts does Bitnami have?
approx 150+


### Task 3: Install a Chart
1. Deploy nginx: `helm install my-nginx bitnami/nginx`
2. Check what was created: `kubectl get all`
3. Inspect the release: `helm list`, `helm status my-nginx`, `helm get manifest my-nginx`

One command replaced writing a Deployment, Service, and ConfigMap by hand.

**Verify:** How many Pods are running? What Service type was created?
1 pods is running as nginx and service type is of LoadBalancer
