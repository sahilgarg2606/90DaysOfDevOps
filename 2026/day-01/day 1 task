Day 01 – My 90 Days DevOps Learning Plan
My Understanding of DevOps & Cloud

DevOps is the practice of automating and integrating development and operations to deliver software faster and more reliably. It focuses on CI/CD, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and collaboration.
Cloud engineering enables scalable, on-demand infrastructure and services (compute, storage, networking) using platforms like AWS, Azure, and GCP.

Why I Am Starting DevOps & Cloud

I want to build a strong career in modern infrastructure and deployment practices. DevOps and Cloud skills are highly in demand and allow me to work on real production systems, automation, and scalable architectures. My goal is to become job-ready and capable of handling real-world deployments and troubleshooting.

My Current Level

Beginner–intermediate IT learner with basic Linux, Git, and development exposure, now moving toward structured DevOps learning.

Where I Want to Reach

In the next 90 days, I want to reach a level where I can:

Deploy applications on cloud infrastructure

Build CI/CD pipelines

Work with containers and Kubernetes

Handle basic production troubleshooting

My 3 Goals for the Next 90 Days

Deploy a production-style application using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD.

Gain hands-on experience with AWS (EC2, S3, IAM, VPC).

Build and document at least 5 real DevOps projects on GitHub.

3 Core DevOps Skills I Will Build

Linux administration & troubleshooting

CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions/Jenkins)

Containerization & orchestration (Docker + Kubernetes)

Weekly Time Commitment

Weekdays: 2–3 hours daily

Weekends: 5–6 hours practice & project work

Total: ~20 hours/week

How I Will Stay Consistent

Follow the 90DaysOfDevOps roadmap daily

Practice hands-on instead of only watching tutorials

Push code and notes to GitHub every day

Share weekly learning updates publicly

Focus on discipline over perfection

My Commitment

For the next 90 days, I will treat this journey like a professional responsibility.
I will show up daily, practice consistently, and build real skills to become a DevOps engineer.
