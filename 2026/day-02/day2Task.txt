Day 02 – Linux Architecture, Processes, and systemd
Core Components of Linux
1) Kernel

Core of the Linux OS

Manages CPU, memory, devices, and processes

Acts as bridge between hardware and software

2) User Space

Where applications run (bash, nginx, docker, etc.)

Users interact with system through commands and programs

3) Init / systemd

First process started in Linux (PID 1)

Starts and manages all services and background processes

Handles system boot and service lifecycle

How Processes Are Created & Managed

Every program running in Linux is a process

Created using fork() and exec() system calls

Each process has:

PID (Process ID)

Parent PID

CPU & memory usage

Linux scheduler decides which process runs and for how long.

Process States

Running (R) → currently executing

Sleeping (S) → waiting for input/output

Stopped (T) → paused manually

Zombie (Z) → finished but entry still exists

Idle → waiting for CPU

What systemd Does & Why It Matters

systemd is the service manager in modern Linux.

Responsibilities:

Boots the system

Starts services (nginx, docker, ssh)

Restarts failed services automatically

Manages logs using journald

Handles service dependencies

Why important for DevOps:

Helps debug production issues

Controls application services

Automates system startup tasks

5 Commands I Will Use Daily
ps aux        # list running processes
top           # real-time CPU & memory usage
htop          # improved process viewer
systemctl     # manage services
journalctl    # view system logs
Practical DevOps Relevance

Understand crashed services using logs

Monitor CPU/memory issues

Restart and manage production applications

Troubleshoot system boot problems

Linux knowledge is essential because most servers run on Linux, and DevOps engineers handle deployments, monitoring, and incident resolution on these systems.
