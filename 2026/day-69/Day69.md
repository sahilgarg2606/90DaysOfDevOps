### Task 2: Understand the Playbook Structure
Open your playbook and annotate each part in your notes:

```yaml
---                                    # YAML document start
- name: Play name                      # PLAY -- targets a group of hosts
  hosts: web                           # Which inventory group to run on
  become: true                         # Run tasks as root (sudo)

  tasks:                               # List of TASKS in this play
    - name: Task name                  # TASK -- one unit of work
      module_name:                     # MODULE -- what Ansible does
        key: value                     # Module arguments
```

Answer:
1. What is the difference between a play and a task?
| Play                    | Task                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------- |
| Play = complete section | Task = single action  |
| Targets hosts/groups    | Performs one work     |
| Contains multiple tasks | Smallest unit of work |

2. Can you have multiple plays in one playbook?
yes
3. What does `become: true` do at the play level vs the task level?
play level
4. What happens if a task fails -- do remaining tasks still run?
remaining tasks fail ho jati hain
